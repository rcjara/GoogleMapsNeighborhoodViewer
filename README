== Overview ==
Google Maps Neighborhood Viewer (name may change) is a simple tool to that
makes use of Google Maps to create panoramas (roughly stitched together) of
entire streets.  It works by having the user select two points on a map, and
then filling in all the intermediate points, and creating two Street View
Panoramas at each intermediate points.  The Panoramas face opposite directions
along the line perpendicular to the one selected by the user.  In this way, a
view of all the buildings lining both sides of a street can be easily created.

== Licence ==
Basically open source.  Fill in more later.
